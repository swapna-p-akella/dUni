### 🎓 dUni – A Decentralized University on Solana & Xandeum

Reimagining lifelong learning through permanent, permissionless access.

#### 🌍 Inspiration

I lost access to my university portal after graduation—and soon after, a hard drive crash wiped out my entire academic archive. Years of lectures, notes, and assignments… gone. That regret stayed with me. Valuable information I once had is now out of reach.

dUni was born from that loss.It’s a decentralized university platform that gives students permanent, global access to their academic journey—forever stored on-chain using the power of Xandeum’s exabyte-scale storage and Solana’s smart contract capabilities.

#### ⚙️ How It Works: Student Journey Lifecycle 

🧑‍🎓 Enroll → Student connects their wallet and registers for a course using Solana smart contracts
📚 Learn → Access lectures, notes, and assignments stored permanently in Xandeum Buckets
📝 Participate → Submit coursework and engage with professors via Livepeer or IPFS
🧠 Evaluation → Professors assess and grade work using platforms like Revise Protocol
🎓 Certify → Student receives an NFT diploma with verifiable metadata through PolygonID or similar
🔐 Reaccess → All content remains accessible anytime, anywhere, forever via wallet + Xandeum storage

#### 💡 Key Features

Decentralized Storage: Every lecture, note, and assignment is stored permanently.
NFT Credentials: Blockchain-verified diplomas that evolve with your learning.
Smart Access: Students retain access for life—no gatekeepers, no portals to expire.
Global Inclusion: Anyone with a wallet can learn and teach.

#### ❓Why Now?

Traditional edtech platforms are limited by storage, access rights, and censorship. Xandeum’s file-like primitives and scalable architecture open the door to truly Web3-native learning ecosystems.

Whether you're a student, teacher, or lifelong learner—dUni is your blockchain-powered campus.
